I finished my mechanical engineering degree, I am currently developing my skills as a developer with Python, data science and machine learning, I have knowledge of Regex, bash, zsh, linux, Git, GitHub, Gitlab, Django, jupyterlabs, nvim, Plotly, etc.

I love to solve code challenges in Codewars and HackerRank, I can spend hours searching and reading code on google to solve them, I like to read the documentation of the methods that I will use, to see what I can use of those extra functions that are there , I think that technology greatly facilitates the way to create new and useful things for everyone. But still I don't think all problems could be solved with code, unless the problem is reframed.

With my acquired knowledge, I have developed some data science projects that I personally and self-taught.
